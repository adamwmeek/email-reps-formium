Oppose HB 1399
I am writing to ask you to oppose HB 1399, which would unfairly prohibit trans youth from gender affirming care. Gender affirming care for trans people is medically recognized as mental health care and access to gender affirming care has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of suicide and increase self esteem in trans youth. There is no valid reason to deny life saving medical care to children. This bill is a partisan attack on the lives of trans children, completely lacking in any medical, scientific, or moral reasoning. Do the right thing and oppose HB 1399. Thank you.

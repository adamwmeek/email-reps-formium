Oppose SB 29
I am writing you today to ask you to oppose SB 29, which would prohibit young trans athletes from participating on teams in alignment with their gender identity. This bill is a partisan attack on our trans youth and ignores the peer-reviewed science showing that trans athletes have no statistically significant advantage over their cis peers. The only this this bill would accomplish is further traumatizing vulnerable kids. Please do the friendly thing and oppose SB 29. Thank you.

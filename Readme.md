This I did for a little fun and in support of trans youth in Texas. I've used Selenium to drive the contact form on the Texas represenative's webpage, facilitating the mass email of represenatives. 

This does save a *lot* of effort in getting a message out. Unfortunately, I get the feeling that I'm going to need this more in the near future.
